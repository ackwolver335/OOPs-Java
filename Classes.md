# Concepts of Classes

A class is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. 

## Requirements of Classes in OOPs

- It is requried for creating the templates for creating objects and helps in binding the code.
- It has the definitions of methods and data if it is not abstract.
- It helps in achieving inheritance, also reducing the code redudancy. And due to its the class hierarchy is maintained.
- It helps to maintain the access modification of the members and methods.

Syntax Code : 

```java
class Example{
    int age;
    Example(){
        System.out.println("Object Created !");
    }
}
```
